This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Perl: accessing an array element beyond its defined index.  The code in `bug.pl` attempts to access the 4th element (index 3) of an array with only 3 elements. Perl does not raise an error in this case, it implicitly returns undef. This can lead to unexpected results or difficult-to-debug problems if not handled carefully. The solution in `bugSolution.pl` shows how to safely access array elements using appropriate checks.
